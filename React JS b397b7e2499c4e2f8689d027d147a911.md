# React JS

- Why functional and not class components?
- Empty tags are called fragments <></>

## Lifecycle of components:

1. Mounting: When the instance just comes into existence is given memory
2. Updation: the user can make changes and the component is re-rendered
3. Unmount: when the instance is removed from memory

### Mounting:

- The instance is first created. Eg.:
    - constructor is used for two purposes:
        - Initialising local state by assigning an object to this.state.
        - Bind event handlers methods to an instance this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind. So, they get a context and not global
        - Don’t call setState() in the constructor. As no user interaction
    - Static
    - getDerivedSrtateFromProps()
    - Render():
        - Only required fn in class components
        - return react elements
        - arrays and fragments [], <></>
        - React.portals
        - strings and numbers. stringified and returned
        - boolean: renders
        - It should be  pure meaning it shouldn’t have any side-effects. Returns same thing with same props
    - didMount():
        - Available after the component has mounted i.e., the HTML from render has finished loading
        - Best place to make API calls as the component has mounted and is avalable at the DOM
        - We can do following things with it:
            - Connect react to external apps such as web APIs or JS frameworks. Like pair it with Jquery
            - set Timers etc
            - add event listeners
            - Draw on an element you just rendered
    - component will mount: called immediately after constructor. Deprecated. don’t use

### Updating:

- Caused by changes t props or state.
- Are called in following order when a component is being re-rendered
- getDerivedSrtateFromProps(props, states):
    - called Exactly at one time
    - uses props to derive a state.
    - invoked before calling the render method
    - Should either return object or null
- ‼️shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState): let react knowif a component output is not affected by current change in state or props.

- render()
- getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(): Receive previous states and previous props.
- componentDidUpdate()
